# Introduction

Story about how Zig is born : 

Desire for higher quality software => most programming languages disqualified => C++ is too  complicated => C has significant problems (preprocessors, macros etc.)
C but with the problems fixed

Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley.

* robust : Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.

* optimal : Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.

* reusable : The same code works in many environments which have different constraints.

* Maintainable : Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and other programmers.

The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.
